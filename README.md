to start locally on windows (I don't have mac):
1) install Node.js, npm and bower globally
2) in terminal run 'npm install' from project root folder
3) in terminal run 'npm start' from project root folder (it may take a while until something happens)
4) once up and running in terminal, it will be available under http://localhost:8000/
